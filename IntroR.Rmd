## R Ecosystem

R is a free  statistical computing software. It can be downloaded from CRAN website for free (https://cran.r-project.org/). The  latest version is R 4.0.2. If you have difficulties in installing the latest version, you can install older versions from (https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/)  - the last is the 3.6.3.  

RStudioâ€™s IDE (Integrated Development Environment) offers a very versatile user interface. There are other IDEs; however, RStudio is the most popular among R users.
It can be installed from (https://rstudio.com/)

Most people want to use cloud services to save their work. RStudio can interface with Git(Hub). You can create a free GitHub account, and save your work in there

update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
Note: this will only look for updates on CRAN. So if you use a package that lives only on GitHub or if you want a development version from GitHub, you will need to update manually, e.g. via devtools::install_github().
